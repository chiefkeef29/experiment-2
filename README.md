Aim:
To study and understand the concept of lists in Python and perform basic operations such as creation, indexing, slicing, updating, and use of built-in list functions.

Theory:
A list in Python is a built-in data structure used to store multiple items in a single variable. Lists are ordered, mutable, and can store elements of different data types such as integers, floats, strings, and Boolean values.

Elements in a list are accessed using indexing, where the index starts from 0. Python also supports negative indexing to access elements from the end of the list. Lists allow slicing to extract a subset of elements.

Various operations can be performed on lists such as adding elements using append() and insert(), extending lists using extend(), modifying elements, and applying built-in functions like len(), max(), min(), and sum() for data analysis.

Due to their flexibility and ease of use, lists are widely used in Python programming.
Algorithm:
	1.	Start the program.
	2.	Create and display a list containing string elements.
	3.	Create and display a list with mixed data types.
	4.	Create a list and access its elements using positive indexing, negative indexing, and slicing.
	5.	Find and display the length of the list using len().
	6.	Modify an element of the list using indexing.
	7.	Add a new element to the list using the append() method.
	8.	Insert an element at a specific position using the insert() method.
	9.	Extend a list by combining it with another list using extend().
	10.	Create a list of marks and find the maximum, minimum, sum, length, and average using built-in functions.
	11.	Create and display a grocery list.
	12.	Stop the program.
	
conclusion: In this experiment, the concept of lists in Python was studied. Various list operations such as creation, indexing, slicing, and use of built-in functions were performed successfully. This experiment helped in understanding how lists can be used to store and manipulate multiple data values efficiently.
