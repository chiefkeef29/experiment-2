Aim:
To study and understand the concept of lists in Python and perform basic operations such as creation, indexing, slicing, updating, and use of built-in list functions.

Theory:
A list in Python is a built-in data structure used to store multiple items in a single variable. Lists are ordered, mutable, and can store elements of different data types such as integers, floats, strings, and Boolean values.

Elements in a list are accessed using indexing, where the index starts from 0. Python also supports negative indexing to access elements from the end of the list. Lists allow slicing to extract a subset of elements.

Various operations can be performed on lists such as adding elements using append() and insert(), extending lists using extend(), modifying elements, and applying built-in functions like len(), max(), min(), and sum() for data analysis.

Due to their flexibility and ease of use, lists are widely used in Python programming.
Algorithm:
	1.	Start the program.
	2.	Create a list with different data elements.
	3.	Display the list elements.
	4.	Access elements using positive and negative indexing.
	5.	Perform slicing to obtain a subset of the list.
	6.	Update elements of the list.
	7.	Add new elements using append() and insert() methods.
	8.	Apply built-in functions such as len(), max(), min(), and sum().
	9.	Display the updated list and results.
	10.	Stop the program.

conclusion: In this experiment, the concept of lists in Python was studied. Various list operations such as creation, indexing, slicing, and use of built-in functions were performed successfully. This experiment helped in understanding how lists can be used to store and manipulate multiple data values efficiently.
